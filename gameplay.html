		     <h2>Gameplay</h2>
			 <p>The gameplay is largely similar to that of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, with the 
			 ability to switch from first to third-person view. Additional features include a split-piece
			 armor system (reminiscent of the armor system in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind), 
			 base-building, a dynamic dialogue system, an in-depth crafting system that makes use of
			 every lootable object in the game as a source of raw material and more. Enemies such as 
			 mole rats, mirelurks, raiders, super mutants, deathclaws, and ghouls return to the
			 series.</p>

			 <p>The player character, the Sole Survivor, accesses the in-game menus through a Pip-Boy
			 to manage statistics, maps, data, and items. Players can also find game cartridges with
			 retro themed mini-games which can be played on the Pip-Boy. Another returning gameplay 
			 feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.), which can play a critical
			 part in combat. While using V.A.T.S, real-time combat is slowed down, and action is played
			 out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of "bullet time." Attacking
			 in V.A.T.S. costs action points, limiting the number of actions available at a time, and 
			 the player can target specific body areas for attacks to inflict specific injuries; headshots
			 can be used for quick kills or blinding, legs can be targeted to slow enemies' movements,
			 and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons.</p>

             <p>A new equipment system allows a wide variety of upgrades and customization for weapons and armor.
			 Unlike the previous two Fallout games, weapons and armor do not deteriorate with use and no longer require constant maintenance.
             A new feature to the series is the ability to build settlements. Within the boundaries of a settlement,
             players can scrap objects and structures for resources and use them to build their own structures,
             including housing, vegetable gardens, defenses, stores, and crafting stations. Each settlement can 
             also connect to others by Brahmin caravan, which then share resources. Towns can be powered with
             electricity, using a dynamic power line system, as well as equipped with water pumps and crops/gardens
             to keep a steady income of food and drink. Merchants and non-player characters can inhabit player 
             towns and help keep the settlements running as a community. Players can build various defenses around
             their settlements, such as turrets, guard towers, and traps, to defend the settlements from raids and
             attacks.</p>

		     <p>Skills have been removed, replaced with a 7x10 perk chart. At each level-up, the player
			 can acquire a new perk, each with prerequisites based on SPECIAL attributes and level, and
			 most have multiple tiers. A consequence of the new advancement system is that there is no
			 hard level cap, allowing players to experience a little more freedom when it comes to
			 exploring and combat. The player may continue playing even after they have finished all
			 of the main quests, a feature returning from Broken Steel, which allows players to 
			 experience the aftermath of their decisions. There are plenty of side quests to pursue,
			 many of which can also be experienced after the main story ends.</p>
